## 🌟About The Project

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. I created this site to serve as a central hub for my projects, skills, and professional background. It was built from the ground up with a focus on clean design, mobile responsiveness, and a smooth user experience.

The goal was to create a modern, professional, and visually appealing site that effectively showcases my journey as a developer.

## ✨ Features

My portfolio includes several key features designed to provide a comprehensive and engaging user experience:

* **🎨 Modern UI Design**: A clean, contemporary design with a focus on readability and aesthetics.
* **📱 Fully Responsive**: A mobile-first approach ensures the site looks and works great on all devices, from desktops to smartphones.
* **🌗 Dark/Light Mode Toggle**: A theme switcher that respects user preferences and saves the chosen theme in local storage.
* **🎬 Smooth Animations**: Subtle, on-scroll animations and transitions that enhance user engagement without being distracting.
* **⭐ Interactive Elements**: Features like a typing animation, hover effects, and a functional contact form (UI only) make the site feel dynamic.
* **📊 Scroll Progress Indicator**: A visual bar at the top that shows the user's progress down the page.
